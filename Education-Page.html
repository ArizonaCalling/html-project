    Astronomy education is the field of study focused on teaching and learning about astronomy, which is the scientific study of celestial objects such as stars, planets, comets, and galaxies, as well as phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere. Astronomy education encompasses formal education in schools and universities, as well as informal education through museums, planetariums, and public outreach programs.

    Overall, astronomy education aims to inspire curiosity about the cosmos and provide students with a deeper understanding of the universe and our place within it.
